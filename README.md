# webserver_monitoring

Abstract

The technique involves writing a Python script that continuously measures various metrics such as response time, resource utilization, traffic count, security breaches, and error occurrences. 
The script uses the requests and psutil modules to measure the response time and resource utilization, respectively, and reads the Nginx access log to count the number of requests in the last minute to measure 
traffic. The script sets several thresholds for these metrics and generates alerts if any of the thresholds are exceeded. The technique can be used to monitor the performance and health of a website and to detect 
and address issues before they impact users.

The code Python script that measures the performance and health of a website by monitoring various metrics such as response time, resource utilization (CPU and memory),
traffic count, security breaches, and error occurrences. The script uses the requests and psutil modules to measure the response time and resource utilization, respectively. It also reads the Nginx access log to 
count the number of requests in the last minute to measure traffic. The script sets several thresholds for these metrics and generates alerts if any of the thresholds are exceeded. The script runs continuously 
and periodically measures the metrics at a fixed interval. If the error count exceeds a certain threshold, the script will exit.

Code description

code is a Python script that monitors the health and performance of a web application by periodically checking various metrics such as response time, uptime, CPU and memory usage, traffic count, and security vulnerabilities.
The script begins by importing necessary modules such as requests, psutil, time, re, and datetime. It also defines several variables such as the URL to be monitored, maximum response time, check interval, uptime threshold, CPU and memory thresholds, error threshold, traffic threshold, and security regex pattern.

Next, it defines several functions to measure various metrics such as response time, resource utilization, and traffic count. The measure_response_time() function sends an HTTP request to the given URL and measures the response time, status code, and content. The measure_resource_utilization() function uses the psutil module to measure CPU and memory usage. The measure_traffic() function reads the access logs of an Nginx server and counts the number of requests made within the last minute.
The script then enters an infinite loop that repeatedly checks the various metrics using the defined functions. If any metric exceeds its corresponding threshold, the script prints an alert message. The script also keeps track of the total number of checks made, the number of successful checks, the number of errors encountered, and the traffic count. If the number of errors exceeds the defined error threshold, the script exits.
Overall, the provided code is a simple but effective way to monitor the health and performance of a web application. However, it may require modifications to suit specific use cases, such as supporting different types of web servers, adding more metrics to monitor, or integrating with external monitoring tools.
